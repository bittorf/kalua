<h1> Pico Peering Agreement v1.0 </h1>

<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>
There are now many community networks, but they are seperated geographically and socially and do not form a coherent network. This document is an attempt to connect those network islands by providing the minimum baseline template for a peering agreement between owners of individual network nodes - the Pico Peering Agreement.
</p>
<p>
The PPA is a way of formalizing the interaction between two peers. Owners of network nodes assert their right of ownership by declaring their willingness to donate the free exchange of data across their networks.
</p>
<p>
The PPA is maintained at http://picopeer.net by a group of volunteers from around the world. It is intended to be used as a template for other small-scale peering documents and licenses.
</p>
