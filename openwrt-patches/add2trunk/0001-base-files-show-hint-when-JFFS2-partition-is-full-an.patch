Subject: [PATCH] [base-files] show hint when JFFS2-partition is full and
 overlayfs mounted read-only

since r45833 and r45848 the overlayfs is automatically mounted read-only
(and blocks remounts as r/w) when JFFS2 is full. see ticket #19564

because of this normal file deletion is not possible anymore.
if a user logins interactively (e.g. SSH) show a hint for this,
that files must be removed in /overlay/upper/...
