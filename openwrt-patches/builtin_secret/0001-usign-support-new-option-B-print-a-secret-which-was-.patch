Subject: [PATCH] usign: support new option '-B': print a secret which was
 included during build

we MUST patch the sourcecode (string PRIME1/PRIME2) before compiling:
we need to include two large random primenumbers, like:

 #!/bin/sh
 P1=$(openssl prime -generate -bits 256)
 P2=$(openssl prime -generate -bits 256)
 sed -e "s/PRIME1/\"$P1\"/" -e "s/PRIME2/\"$P2\"/" main.c

after that, a user can prove that he knows the
solution (two prime factors) to a serverside stored "product",
which is generated for each image, so the user can prove,
that he really flashed the image, and that it works.
